# The iOS 17 "BLE Crash Exploit"
The exploit was originaly developed and discovered by ECTO-1A. I ported it to the ESP32 and to RPi (and any devices that can run python). The scipts are meant for the ESP32, as the ESP8266 doesnt have BLE. The exploit causes the device to crash while it is locked on the homescreen.

# Testing
This was tested on a ESP32S3 on: <br>
-iPhone 14 Pro - iOS 17.1 (21B506)<br>

This was tested on a ESP-WROOM-32 on: <br>
-iPhone 12 Pro - iOS 17.0 (21A329)<br>

RPi 4: <br>
-iPhone XS - iOS 17.0 (21A329)<br>
-iPhone 12 Pro - iOS 17.1 Beta 2

# Behavior
The iPhone after around 5 seconds of spamming with some popups the iPhone starts to freeze. After a random looking amount of time the iPhone turns completely black and you can now force restart it (Volume UP, Volume Down, Hold power button). Sometimes the iPhone restarts by itself. In this procedure the ESP shouldnt get hot.
